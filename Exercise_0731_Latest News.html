        <h2>Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg, Gov. Murphy break ground on Portal North Bridge</h2>
        <p>
            Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Gov. Phil Murphy were in Kearny this morning to formally break ground on the long-delayed Portal North Bridge.
        </br>    
            The new $2.2 billion rail bridge is designed to lessen delays for commuters and keep the regional economy going strong. Itâ€™s also a new key component in the progressing Gateway transportation project.
        </br>
            "All of this adds up to public service at its best," said Buttigieg. "The infrastructure you see here is so consequential that if there were to be a failure here you could feel the economic results as far away as where I grew up in Indiana."

        <h2>Police issue over 130 citations after hundreds found partying at abandoned strip mine</h2>
        <p>
            Police say it's an ongoing issue. Partiers from all over New Jersey and the surrounding states take their off-road vehicles, and even watercraft vehicles, to a 7,000-acre site known as Heritage Minerals, a now-defunct strip mine with several lakes. Over the years, it's become a popular place but also been the site of drownings, fatal crashes and forest fires.
