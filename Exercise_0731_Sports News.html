                    <p>Roselle Catholic (Roselle, N.J.), the New Jersey Tournament of Champions winner and No. 3 team in our way-too-early high school basketball rankings for 2022-23, bolstered its roster with the addition of five-star prospect and Duke commit Mackenzie Mgbako.

                        Mgbako, a 6-foot-8, 200-pound forward, announced the news Thursday via Twitter. As a junior at Gill St. Bernard's, he led the Knights to the NJSIAA North Non-Public B title game while averaging 19.5 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.9 assists to earn first team MaxPreps Junior All-America honors.

                    <p>The most intelligent player on the court - that’s not a conventional compliment given to just any athlete, but Williamstown head coach Chris Sheppard has all the confidence in the world calling Joanna Andrews just that.

                        “Her mind is three steps ahead of everyone else,” Sheppard said.
                        
                        To win 37 games in a season without losing once, it takes more than power. Skill, awareness and leadership are all just as crucial for a team to reach that level of success. Put all of these traits together, and you get someone like Andrews.</p>

                    <p>After a program-defining season, the Powhatan girls lacrosse team saw five athletes named to the Richmond Times-Dispatch All-Metro Team that was announced on Wednesday, July 27.

                        Leading the team was graduate and team captain Jordan Krauss, who capped off a brilliant career with the Indians as a first team All-Metro member. Krauss brought in tons of accolades for her senior season, also being named a first team All-Region and All-State member.
                        
                        Now getting ready to play at the collegiate level at Christopher Newport University, the quarterback of Powhatan’s offense leaves the school with 100 career goals and over 200 career points.
                        
                        In her final season, the four-year starter recorded 53 goals and 49 assists with 34 ground balls. Her high-level lacrosse IQ and patience as a feeder will be missed by the Indians, who look to build off their incredible 2022 season</p>
