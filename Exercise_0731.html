            Miss Manners: ‘Good morning’ not always to be taken literally
            </br>DEAR MISS MANNERS: After the tragedy in Uvalde, the chief of police began his statement with the greeting, “Good afternoon.”

            </br>The next day, after an understandably sleepless night, I arrived at my job -- at a school -- filled with grief, only to be told “Good morning!” by five different colleagues.
            
            </br>All of these greetings seemed insensitive considering the circumstances. Are these good manners? Is this an appropriate greeting under the circumstances?

            Annual N.J. fair that started in 1947 stays true to its agricultural roots (PHOTOS)
            </br>The Gloucester County 4-H Fair wrapped up Sunday after four days of competitions, exhibitions and festivities.

            </br>The fair, which began in 1947, remains “true to its original purpose,” showing off the agricultural roots of the county despite the fact there are fewer rural areas, according to information on the Rutgers website.

            </br>There were many competitions held, including the 4-H Dairy Show, 4-H Swine Show, 4-H Agility Competition, 4-H Invitational Goat Show, an Open Western Horse Show, and Open Hunter Show.
